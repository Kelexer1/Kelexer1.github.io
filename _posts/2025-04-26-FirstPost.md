I was actually planning to get the blog part of my website done a couple months ago. *However*, my university decided to dump a small island worth of various assignment and thingamajigs, followed by immediately final exams. So unsurprisingly, I've been kind of busy since March 10, 2025 (Yes, it took 3 months, stop judging me).

There actually used to be a portfolio page that would accompany the blog (or it was *planned* to), but I've decided I am lazy, and do not want to make 2 pages that basically serve the same purpose. Instead, I'll be tagging projects and portfolio items with #project and #portfolio, respectively. I'll also tag them with other relevant tags, like the coding languages and other software's that are used because why not.

Regardless, I finished exams and immediately sat down to finish this page up, and I'm aiming to consistently post about a lot of stuff, including some older projects I've completed in the past but never really documented or showed off, so keep an eye out for that.

Also, I'm still working on the blog page, I'll be aiming to update a few cosmetic things over the coming days to make it not-so-plain, particularly on the post page. Thats all for now.
