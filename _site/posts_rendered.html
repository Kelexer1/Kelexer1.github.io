                <h3 class="postSubtitle">How I conceptualized, designed, and built the UI of my blog</h3>
              
            </div>
            
              <div class="postExcerpt"><p>In my last blog post, I talked about how I used the finalized blog to expedite the post creation process by taking advantage of tools I created, and others such as Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and Obsidian. In this post, Ill delve deeper into the front end UI design process behind the blog, from conceptualizing the UI, to making a mock UI, to creating the HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the hardest part of making a page is figuring out what you want the page to look like. I wouldn’t consider myself an artist or expert designer, so I’m basically working off the same level of skill as any other person. It didn’t help that I didn’t really even know what I wanted the page to look like in my head, let alone making a concrete feature list, so that was the first step. What I found really helped was looking at online resources, such as blog examples, and making a list of all the cool stuff I found, regardless if I wanted to include it in the final product. Additionally, I found generative AI very helpful for brainstorming cool ideas, even though after a few prompts all the creativity seemed to drain out. Once I had a list of features and other design considerations, I was able to move onto the next step, making a mock UI.</p>

<p>I used my iPad to draw the mock-up by hand. While I am sure there are better graphic design tools out there to make the process likely easier (Figma <em>cough cough</em>), I liked having that ease of creating and deleting specific aspects, as well as the more personal touch it gave the mock-ups. This is also the stage where I started considering the technical aspects of the page, such as the search features. Having a comprehensive list of stuff I wanted to have, and narrowing it down by eliminating unneeded stuff turned this into more of a puzzle assembling task rather than a mental gymnastics one. Another thing that really helped is labelling specific elements of the mock-up UI. For example, adding labels to what specific buttons would do etc. really helped cement a vision of the final product in my head, which is definitely required for the last step. Below is an image of the current state of the mock-up drawing. There are a couple of things I want to point out about it. First, you might notice that some stuff is not the same as the final product, which is perfectly fine considering this is a mock-up that was made in about 30 minutes. Secondly, items highlighted in yellow are currently not implemented (as of writing this post), so the mock-up can double as a sort of interactive to-do list.</p>

<p><img src="/Resources/BlogResources/2025-05-02-BlogDesignProcess2/Mockup.png" alt="Blog UI Mockup" /></p>

<p>Once I had the mock-up, I was able to start the process of translating it into HTML and CSS, starting with the HTML. The best way I found to do this was to make the page from top to bottom, and grouping related elements together (pretty standard practice). Then, I could use my knowledge of HTML to create the proper elements in the correct order, and group them using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">divs</code>, which serve to group content in HTML. After this, I was left with a basic scaffolding of the blog page, excluding any actual posts, as those need to be implemented with a mix of JS, though I did make a template using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template</code> tag that I could clone in the JS portion to render posts.</p>

<p>The next and final step was implementing the CSS styling to make the site look good. I would also like to point out that the mock-up drawing is severely lacking in the styling department, as it omits many critical details like colouring and other styling choices. I was aware this would be a problem when I made it, but I chose to go along with it anyways because I was still unsure about the structure, let alone the styling. As a result, this stage had a lot more thinking and planning compare to the HTML stage. Of course this resulted in a longer time to implement, especially between consulting various resources about obscure CSS tags so that the entire site didn’t look like melting candle wax. Some important considerations I made when designing the CSS was, first and foremost, conformity to general themes of the site, such as colour and font. Additionally, I wanted to keep a sort of minimalist look that had clear separations between different posts, while also being spacious with large margins.</p>

<p>Overall, the design of the blog was probably my <em>least</em> favourite part of the entire process, but I’m very happy with how it turned out. I am still planning to add numerous things to the blog page, including…</p>

<ul>
  <li>A footer</li>
  <li>Some form of pagination</li>
  <li>A better background (will be used site-wide)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, these features are outside of the scope of this post and will likely have their own posts in the future. That’s all for now.</p>

            </div>
            
              <div class="postExcerpt"><p>I’ve spent the past 2 weeks self teaching NASM x86 Assembly (primarily on Linux), and I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences from what I’ve learned, and how I plan to apply and further my skills.</p>

<p>Programming languages can be ranked on a sort of scale, from high level to low level. The “higher” level a language is, the closer the syntax to human readable language. Take python for example, where printing a message to the console is as easy as the one line solution:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course there is a lot more going on behind the scenes automatically, which is why high level languages like Python are so easy to learn and write in compared to other languages. Now this automation usually comes at the cost of speed and bloat, where code may not be fully optimized due to the automated optimizations and extra features of the language that your program may not require. That’s where lower level languages, like C, come into play. When you write code in C, you are expected to manage a lot more with your code than simply the syntax. With C, you are expected to manually manage your computer memory, and forgo commonly used features, like object-oriented programming. This however, comes at the benefit of <em>much</em> faster runtimes compared to languages like Python (even if you account for the fact that Python is interpreted, not compiled). Additionally, lower level languages allow you to work much closer to the hardware of the computer, such as the memory, as previously mentioned. This can allow for much more optimizations in your code, as well as accomplishing tasks that are just not realistic in higher level languages (think device drivers, etc.). For comparison, here is the same code as above, but written in C instead:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">"Hello, world!"</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">endl</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, notice that I haven’t mentioned where assembly fits into all of this, and I’m getting to that. I mentioned how python is interpreted, not compiled, which basically means the computer reads it line by line and works with the code that way. Compiled languages convert your code into assembly (CPU instructions), which the computer then works with. This is how compiled languages run so fast. Of course, there is more nuance to how this stuff works, but it is a very broad and complicated topic (I also have never explicitly learned about it, yet), though this is a high level explanation. Now, here is the same code written in NASM x86 Assembly (Linux), which would then need to be manually assembled and linked to be ran:</p>

<div class="language-nasm highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">section</span> <span class="nv">.data</span>
	<span class="nf">output</span> <span class="nv">DB</span> <span class="s">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span>

<span class="nf">section</span> <span class="nv">.text</span>
	<span class="nf">global</span> <span class="nv">_start</span>

<span class="nl">_start:</span>
	<span class="nf">MOV</span> <span class="nb">eax</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
	<span class="nf">MOV</span> <span class="nb">ebx</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
	<span class="nf">MOV</span> <span class="nb">ecx</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">output</span>
	<span class="nf">MOV</span> <span class="nb">edx</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">14</span>
	<span class="nf">INT</span> <span class="mh">80h</span>

	<span class="nf">MOV</span> <span class="nb">eax</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
	<span class="nf">MOV</span> <span class="nb">ebx</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
	<span class="nf">INT</span> <span class="mh">80h</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As you can see, assembly appears to be maybe just a <em>little</em> bit harder to read…</p>

<p>Assembly used to the the language that hid under my bed at night, and that was mostly reinforced by things like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels, where they portray assembly as the boss battle of programming languages. And don’t get me wrong, I still think it is, but I can now say that the difficulty is <em>not</em> as high as media claims it to be.</p>

<p>I originally wanted to pick up assembly for a few reasons. Namely, I wanted to further my cybersecurity skills by getting started on reverse engineering programs. When you run a file like a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.exe</code> on your computer, you are actually executing a binary file of machine code, which can be decompiled to assembly using a tool known as a decompiler. Now, while you can continue to go “higher” into even more readable languages, the output will become increasingly nonsense, as there is <em>many</em> ways to make code with the same output, so the decompiler has no way of determining the “correct” output, so it will try to guess, which doesn’t always work out well. That’s why assembly is preferred for reverse engineering. By the end of this initial learning phase, I wanted to take part in a “crack me” to see if I could actually read real programs decompiled into assembly and reverse engineer / modify them to create desirable results, in this case being able to gain access to a software without a licence key. Don’t worry, crack me’s are mock software’s designed to be reverse engineered, so there is nothing illegal about it.</p>

<p>Secondly, I wanted to actually be able to read and write in assembly using documentation, and not AI like ChatGPT. Of course, in the process of learning it, I would memorize a lot of commonly used instructions, but learning how to read detailed documentation is a beneficial skill independent of programming language. I would also be able to demonstrate this by reverse engineering a program.</p>

<p>I mainly learned the language using the following playlist, which was super helpful and easy to follow along, although I was on my own when figuring out how to set up a Linux VM and install all the required packages.</p>
<iframe width="819.5" height="461" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBO-EJoVDo0?list=PL2EF13wm-hWCoj6tUBGUmrkJmH1972dBB" title="Foundations of Assembly Programming - Binary Numbers" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Once I completed all the videos in the playlist that dealt with assembly programming (omitting the operating system content in the second half) I felt I had a pretty solid understanding of the material, and I was already able to code basic programs with minimal additional learning resources. Therefore, I made my first attempt at using Ghidra to reverse engineer a crack me that I got from <a href="https://crackmes.one/crackme/67fd376f8f555589f3530b9d">https://www.crackmes.one</a>.</p>
<h2 id="crack-me-write-up">Crack Me Write Up</h2>

<p>The first step was to run the program itself and try to get a high understanding of how the program worked. Entering an invalid key gave a specific string error message, which is crucial for reverse engineering. If I could find the string reference in the decompiled assembly, I could find what parts of the code are causing the message to be displayed, then backtrack to find the code for the block that determines whether the key is valid.</p>

<p><img src="/Resources/BlogResources/2025-05-02-AboutAssembly/InvalidKey.jpg" alt="Image of invalid key result" /></p>

<p>Then, we can use Ghidra to decompile the program, which will give us access to all the scary looking source code (the program itself was written in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C++</code>, then compiled into this). Ghidra looks complicated to use (because it is), but 99% of the features are not required to complete a basic crack me like this. Analyzing the file will format the source code into the assembly we are looking for.</p>

<p><img src="/Resources/BlogResources/2025-05-02-AboutAssembly/GhidraAnalyze.jpg" alt="Image of Ghidra analyze menu" /></p>

<p>After that, we can use the string search tool to scan the entire source code for the text “Invalid Licence”. This is helpful because, as previously mentioned, we can find what part of the code is telling the program to give the warning message, and change it to always accept an invalid key.</p>

<p><img src="/Resources/BlogResources/2025-05-02-AboutAssembly/GhidraString.jpg" alt="Image of Ghidra string search tool" /></p>

<p>As you can see in the image, we have located two important strings, the invalid key string, and the valid key string. It doesn’t really matter which one we follow through the code, as they should end up at roughly the same spot in the code. We will follow the invalid key string for consistency, which takes us to the following block of code:</p>

<p><img src="/Resources/BlogResources/2025-05-02-AboutAssembly/GhidraStringTrace.jpg" alt="Image of Ghidra string trace" /></p>

<p><strong>A quick note: The comment reading “Success Code” should say “Display Message Box”</strong></p>

<p>In the this image, I have highlighted important CPU instructions in yellow, and comments I have made explaining the code in blue, since Ghidra’s GUI can be overwhelming to look at. Additionally, I have traced the flow of the code for valid and invalid keys in blue and red, respectively. In general, though, this code checks if the value in register R14B (This is related to the value the user entered, but it may have been altered or have other stuff done to it before this point). If the value is equal to 0, meaning the string is empty or contains only null bytes, then the code jumps to the invalid licence prompt, which is assigned the label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LAB_1400017e4</code> by Ghidra (labels are segments of code with a specific title). Otherwise, it continues and goes straight to the success prompt. To make this code work in our favor, we want the code to never enter the invalid key label, since that will set the message values to be the incorrect key values. We can do this by negating the condition of the jump instruction from equals 0, to not-equals 0. When we do this, we effectively make incorrect keys correct, and correct keys incorrect. Applying this fix is as simple as modifying the second yellow-highlighted instruction to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JNZ LAB_1400017e4</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JZ LAB_1400017e4</code>. Now, when we enter an invalid key, it will not go into the incorrect key label, and will instead set the value of the message box to be the values that indicate a successful key, then it will jump to label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LAB_1400017f2</code>, which will display the message box with whatever values have been set, whether from the success or fail parts of the code. We are now left with the following assembly instructions:</p>

<p><img src="/Resources/BlogResources/2025-05-02-AboutAssembly/GhidraPatched.jpg" alt="Image of patched assembly instructions" /></p>

<p>Exporting this new program gives us an executable that is identical in every way, except its set to accept invalid license keys as valid. We can verify this by running the new program and entering a random value.</p>

<p><img src="/Resources/BlogResources/2025-05-02-AboutAssembly/GhidraFinal.jpg" alt="Image of final result" /></p>

<p>And just like that, we have cracked this mock software using the power of assembly and decomplication. Even though this is a very easy task compared to real-world applications of decompilation, I am still proud of myself for being able to do this on my own with minimal supplementary learning (except googling what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LEA</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TEST</code> do, since the course I used didn’t cover them). I plan to continue to further my assembly skills along with my cybersecurity skills by delving into more advanced topics now that I have a strong foundation to build off of.</p>

<p>That’s all for now.</p>

            </div>
            
              <div class="postExcerpt"><p>In my previous post, I mainly talked about the fact that the blog part of my website was live, which is <em>cool</em>, but I think what’s cooler is all the juicy software and code that went into making it (excluding the hair-loss). Therefore, through the course of multiple posts, I’ll dive deeper into the how and why thought process that I used to design the blog, from UI to code, to other important design considerations such as scalability and maintainability. Furthermore, I will structure it as both a documentation and tutorial set of posts, so you can follow along and make your own blog (assuming you already have a website set up). The structure of the posts will be as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Creating posts using Jekyll</li>
  <li>The UI design of the blog page</li>
  <li>The JS of the blog page</li>
  <li>The design of the post page</li>
</ol>

<p>As you might have already figured, this entire website is statically hosted on GitHub Pages completely for free. While this is awesome and usually more than enough for me, it does make it a little more complicated when considering something like a blog, where ideally you could fetch posts from a server, instead of storing all of the posts on the website itself. To lessen this fallback, GitHub Pages makes use of Jekyll, a static site generator, which <strong>does</strong> provide a lot of useful tools for blogging and general site-building, such as…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic pagination</li>
  <li>A simplified post creation process</li>
  <li>Automatic page building that supports Liquid</li>
  <li>A couple others that I can’t think of on the spot…</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I quickly came to the conclusion that, while speeding up the creation process, these features didn’t do much to address the set up process of the blog, so I was largely on my own. I had a few important features I wanted my blog to have, namely the searching posts by content, along with tagging (and tag filtering) to allow merging of the portfolio page with the blog page. This will be important shortly.</p>

<p>Jekyll’s post process allows users to have a folder in their sites directory, labelled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code>, that will contain HTML or MD files (I prefer Markdown for writing posts). The files need to follow a specific naming convention that is as follows: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-Title</code>. For example, this post’s file name is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2025-04-27-BlogDesignProcess1.md</code>. Each post is given front-matter that will specify some data that can automatically be fetched and embedded into both the preview of the post (on the blog page), and the full post’s page. For example, for this post, the YAML front-matter is as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: post
catgories: blog
image: Resources/KelexerLogo.svg
title: Building a blog page using Jekyll
subtitle: How I create posts efficiently using Jekyll
date: 2025-04-27
tags: [blog, website, tutorial]
---
*The text you are reading goes here*
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The layout variable simply states that this file should be rendered using the post layout, which is a template I made for presenting the post (meaning I don’t have to make an HTML file for every single post). I’ll go into more detail about the post page in a further blog post. The categories variable is similar to how tagging is used, but I made my own tagging system to have more control over how data is organized. Therefore, I always keep it as blog. The image, title, and subtitle, and date variables are fairly self explanatory, and you can actually see how the post layout uses these variables at the very top of the post, pretty cool right? Lastly, we have my personal favourite, the tags variable, which is a list of tags I want the post to be associated with. Its useful for filtering and conveying that kind of topics and themes will be present to the viewer before they even read.</p>

<p>Once the front-matter is defined, you can simply write whatever you want below it (I like using Obsidian for writing in Markdown), and that will become the content that is displayed on the post (front matter will be automatically omitted in the file users read). Funny enough, that’s all the set up you need to do to make a new post, everything else is a one-time setup that is designed to handle everything, emphasizing scalability and maintainability.</p>

<p>Overall, I made sure that the creating posts would be as effortless and fast as possible by taking advantage of the various tools that Jekyll offers makes the entire process for blogging just a little faster. On the next post, I’ll go into more detail on the UI design process for the blog page, from planning to creating. That’s all for now.</p>

              <div class="postExcerpt"><p>I was actually planning to get the blog part of my website done a couple months ago. <em>However</em>, my university decided to dump a small island worth of various assignment and thingamajigs, followed by immediately final exams. So unsurprisingly, I’ve been kind of busy since March 10, 2025 (Yes, it took 3 months, stop judging me).</p>

<p>There actually used to be a portfolio page that would accompany the blog (or it was <em>planned</em> to), but I’ve decided I am lazy, and do not want to make 2 pages that basically serve the same purpose. Instead, I’ll be tagging projects and portfolio items with #project and #portfolio, respectively. I’ll also tag them with other relevant tags, like the coding languages and other software’s that are used because why not.</p>

<p>Regardless, I finished exams and immediately sat down to finish this page up, and I’m aiming to consistently post about a lot of stuff, including some older projects I’ve completed in the past but never really documented or showed off, so keep an eye out for that.</p>

<p>Also, I’m still working on the blog page, I’ll be aiming to update a few cosmetic things over the coming days to make it not-so-plain, particularly on the post page. Thats all for now.</p>
